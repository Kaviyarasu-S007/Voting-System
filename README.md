# Electoral Commission Project - E-Systems

## Introduction

The Electoral Commission Project - E-Systems aims to create an electronic solution for managing electoral processes efficiently. An electoral system, or voting system, involves a set of rules governing elections and referendums. These rules cover various aspects of the voting process, including voter eligibility, candidate qualifications, ballot marking and casting, vote counting, campaign spending limits, and more. Political electoral systems are defined by constitutions and laws, typically overseen by election commissions.
